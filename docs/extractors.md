# Extractors

unblob relies on various tools for extracting the contents of a blob. These
extractors are either **third party tools (e.g. 7z)**, or part of unblob (available
in [`unblob/extractors`](https://github.com/onekey-sec/unblob/tree/main/unblob/extractors)
directory or specific ones next to the handler, e.g.:
[`unblob/handlers/filesystem/romfs.py`](https://github.com/onekey-sec/unblob/blob/3008039881a0434deb75962e7999b7e35aca8271/unblob/handlers/filesystem/romfs.py#L334)).

To use unblob with all supported formats, **all extractors need to be installed**.

See the [Installation section](installation.md) on how to install extractors for
various methods. You _don't need_ to install any of these _if you use Docker or Nix_,
as all extractors are included in those solutions.

## Checking installed extractors

There is a `--show-external-dependencies` CLI option, which displays the name of
the extractors used by unblob and shows if they are available for unblob to use
or not:

```shell
$ unblob --show-external-dependencies
The following executables found installed, which are needed by unblob:
    7z                          ✓
    debugfs                     ✓
    jefferson                   ✓
    lz4                         ✓
    lziprecover                 ✓
    lzop                        ✓
    sasquatch                   ✓
    sasquatch-v4be              ✓
    simg2img                    ✓
    ubireader_extract_files     ✓
    ubireader_extract_images    ✓
    unar                        ✓
    zstd                        ✓
```

**NOTE**: This option does NOT check the version of the extractors.

## Required extractors

❌: If you installed unblob from source, you need to install these manually.

✅: These extractors come with unblob, check
[pyproject.toml](https://github.com/onekey-sec/unblob/blob/main/pyproject.toml)
and [pdm.lock](https://github.com/onekey-sec/unblob/blob/main/pdm.lock)
for current versions.
